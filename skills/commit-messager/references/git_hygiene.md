# Git Hygiene

Use this reference when the target repository has no project-local commit scope or Git hygiene guidance.

Before applying these fallback rules, check the target repository root for `GIT_HYGIENE.md`. Use `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.commit-scopes.md`, `.commit-message.md`, or similar documents only as compatibility fallbacks. Project-local scope guidance wins over this reference.

## Subject

Use the Angular-style subject:

```text
type(scope): short summary
```

Keep the summary imperative, specific, and under 72 characters when practical.

## Types

- `feat`: user-visible capability or meaningful new workflow
- `fix`: bug fix or correction of broken behavior
- `refactor`: behavior-preserving restructuring
- `docs`: documentation-only change
- `test`: test-only change
- `chore`: tooling, maintenance, configuration, or repository housekeeping
- `style`: formatting-only change

Prefer the type that describes the main behavioral intent, not the largest file count.

## Scopes

Choose one short lowercase scope from the changed area. Prefer stable project vocabulary over one-off names. If the project has a root-level scope record, reuse its vocabulary.

Scope priority:

1. Feature or user-facing workflow: `auth`, `search`, `checkout`
2. Package, module, or command: `api`, `cli`, `worker`
3. Shared layer or tool: `hooks`, `scripts`, `config`, `deps`
4. Documentation group: `docs`, `readme`
5. Repository-wide fallback: `repo`

Use the same scope for related follow-up commits unless the changed area clearly moves elsewhere.

If no project-local scope record exists and the user is formalizing commit hygiene, suggest creating `GIT_HYGIENE.md` in the repository root so future agents can reuse the same scope vocabulary.

Avoid:

- File extensions as scopes, such as `py` or `md`
- Overly broad scopes, such as `app`, when a narrower stable area exists
- New synonyms for an existing scope
- `repo` when a specific scope is defensible

## Body Sections

Use body sections only when they add useful context beyond the subject.

```text
[aim]
<why this change is needed>

[approach]
- <implementation choice or changed area>
- <another implementation point, if needed>

[attention]
- <risk, migration note, test gap, or reviewer note>
- <another note, if needed>
```

Use bullets in `[approach]` and `[attention]` when there is more than one point. A single point may be one sentence without a bullet. Omit empty sections.

## Footers

For commits drafted or made in an AI agent session, put the resume footer near the end:

```text
codex resume <SESSION_ID>
```

Use `claude resume <SESSION_ID>` only when the active agent context is Claude rather than Codex. If `SESSION_ID` is unavailable, omit the footer rather than inventing an ID.

When an issue id is directly relevant and known, put it after the resume footer:

```text
Refs: #<ISSUE_ID>
```
